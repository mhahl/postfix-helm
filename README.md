Postfix is a Mail Transport Agent (MTA). (check existing examples)

## TL;DR

```console
$ helm repo add my-repo https://helm.hahl.id.au/
$ helm install my-release my-repo/postfix
```

## Introduction

Install postfix.

## Prerequisites

- Kubernetes 1.19+
- Helm 3.2.0+
- PV provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
- ReadWriteMany volumes for deployment scaling

## Installing the Chart

To install the chart with the release name `my-release`:

```console
helm install my-release my-repo/postfix
```

The command deploys postfix on the Kubernetes cluster in the default configuration. The [Parameters](#parameters) section lists the parameters that can be configured during installation.

> **Tip**: List all releases using `helm list`

## Uninstalling the Chart

To uninstall/delete the `my-release` deployment:

```console
helm delete my-release
```

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Parameters

Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm install`. For example,

```console
helm install my-release \
    my-repo/postfix
```

```console
helm install my-release -f values.yaml my-repo/postfix
```

> **Tip**: You can use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml)
